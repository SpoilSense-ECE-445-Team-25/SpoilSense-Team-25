A repository that will act as our lab note book for our ECE 445 Senior Design project: SpoilSense. 

Food waste and the subsequent loss of quality and nutrition continue to pose a major challenge in many households, as produce often spoils unnoticed until it is too late. Frequent manual checks can be inconvenient and time-consuming, while existing monitoring solutions are frequently unreliable, expensive, or overly complex to integrate. This paper details the development of SpoilSense, a system designed to address this gap by providing households with a cost-effective and automated method of identifying produce spoilage.
