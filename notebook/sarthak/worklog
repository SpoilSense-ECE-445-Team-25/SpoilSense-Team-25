Week 1 - 9/30
This week the objective was to continue finalizing our design doc and get started on a schematic. 
We are still struggling a bit figuring out what our sub systems will look but we had a basic idea at the beginning of the week.
--> Mon - Wed
Understood what our modules wanted to look like at a high level but having trouble with the specifics (communication protocols, BLE vs WIFI, 
and how we want the sensors to interact)
Also, began brainstorming what types of sensors are good for what we want and if they will even work.
--> Thurs - Fri
We were able to finalize the design doc, confirmed the specifics of our subsystems including the sensor (ethylene) and what kinda of 
communication protocol we want to use.
Also secured our high level requirements that we will work towards when developing our project:
1. The module should be accurate in detecting the presence of ethylene (threshold unknown yet) in order to trigger an alert.
2. The design should be capable of withstanding standard refrigerator temperatures and should maintain a form factor that is 
at most dimensions of  5 in x 4 in x 2 in. 
3. The system must respond to detected ethylene gas concentration changes and trigger an alert within 30 seconds of the threshold being met.

Week 2 - 10/7
Goal is to get ready for the design review and explain the relative design we want to implement as well get help/feedback from TAs at the
PCB review.
We are continuing to build the schematic for our CAD model but need help setting up the corrrect ESP.
--> Mon - Wed
Presented the design doc to the TAs and got some feedback on our high level requirements.
Should focus more on just being able to get a secure connection bc might be difficult through metal (will test)
Not sure how to configure the ESP for our modules will seek help during PCB review.
--> Thurs - Fri
Got a lot of feedback from PCB Review:
-Told to try out testing spoilage with VOC sensor instead (use breakboards to test and get working before PCB)
-Given caution about ethylene sensor bc it is quite specific
-Look into using through hole LEDs for the external module may be easier 
-Given an outline on what an ESP should look like including the USB to flash it as well as debugging tools

Week 3 - 10/14
Make progress on the schmeatic adn try to get an order in on PCBway by the first order deadline. Also, test get VOC sensor and utilize
ESP devkit in order to try to get data readings for the sensor 
--> Mon - Wed
Working on schematic but not sure how to set up circuit with the ESP and hook up the sensors to it. Also unsure how we want to proceed 
with our external module. Having trouble finding/uploading valid footprints for the parts we want. 
The ethylene sensor we want to use does not have an easily downloadable version to import into Kicad.
Also having issues with having extensive enough datasheets that tells how to hook up the sensor and information about pin layouts.
--> Thurs - Fri
Got necessary VOC sensor devboard for testing.
Soldered parts together in order to use on the breadboard.
Attempted to configure ESP devkit with arduino IDE in order to get sensor readings to output.

Week 4 - 10/21
Continue testing with devkit
Order necessart parts for PCB and get CAD model working and able to order.
--> Mon - Wed
Continued working on the schematic trying to finalize for the next round of orders 
Continue testing BME sensor on breadboard, making sense of readings trying to set necessary thresholds
--> Thurs - Fri
Still struggling with footprints, not able to find ones that are viable and have enough documentation for us
Also having issues with software, importing necessary parts are not working
Will continue to work, try to order in next round. 

Week 5 - 10/28
