# Azim Shad Work Log

Week of 9/2: Brainstorming Ideas
Think of final project ideas: food spoilage detecter, morning routine device, smart mirror
Brainstorm working solutions for each of these ideas to gauge the interest and feasibility of project

Week of 9/9: Project Selection and Approval
Decide to pursue the food spoilage detector idea
Design will include various sensors to monitor moisture, temp, humididty, and various gases
There will be an alert system to alert user of spoilage
Completed RFA approval with team

Week of 9/16: Planning and Enclosure Design
Talk with the TA to go over the RFA requirements and an understanding of the proposal
Begin working on an idea for the enclosure that will house the internal and external modules
Named the project Spoil Sense
Azim meets with the TA to clarify RFA requirements and the proposal process. He consults Gregg about potential enclosure designs for the food freshness detector, now named "SpoilSense."

Week of 9/30: Design Document and Sensor Orders
Worked on Design document
Ordered ethylene sesnsor
Met with TA over PCB design and understanding how to build the schematic with all the neccessary componenents

Week of 10/7: Addressing Design Review Feedback
Waiting for sensor to arrive
Considering a pivot to new sensor because cannot begin testing since ethylene sensor will take too long to arrive
Design review for initial PCB design
Switch design from SMD LEDs to throughole LEDs

Week of 10/14: PCB and Microcontroller Development
Working on PCB design facing various issues with footprint and challenges using KiKad
Cannot find footprint for ethylene sensor, seriously considering pivoting to a new sensor
Pivoting off of tempearture and humidity sensors as they don't really help detect spoilage

Week of 10/21: PCB Design and BME680 Testing
Encountering issues with PCB footprints
Confirming parts for PCB orders
Pivoted to BME680 sensor because it is another VOC sensor and ethylene sensor still has not arrived
Started testing for BME680 sensor
Finalized and ordered PCB with BME680 sensor

Week of 10/28: Progress with Microcontroller and Sensors
BME680 sensor testing is not going as planned, started looking into other sensors for better spoilage detection
Update PCB Design to include MICS-5524 VOC sensor to detect methane and ammonia 
Ordered MICS-5524 VOC sensor

Week of 11/4: Sensor Testing and PCB Revisions
Sensor testing with MICS-5524 VOC sensor in a controlled environment
Collect data of various foods and aggregate them together to find a baseline threshold to use to detect spoilage
Updated design doc and resubmitted for grading
1st PCB order arrives
Need to reorder because there is a missing power supply and the wrong sensor

Week of 11/11: Finalizing PCB and Preparing for Demo
Continued testing with MICS-5524 sensor
Updated second PCB design with the updated and corrected power distribution system
Updated the correct sensor into PCB
Found a thresholf of 3000 ppm and 50 ppm for CH4 and NH3
Submitted PCB order

Week of 11/18: Mock Demo and Prototype Testing
Mainly BLE testing, helping with testing as needed
Presented working prototype during mock demo with TA
PCB order did not arrive in time

Week of 12/2: Final Demo and Presentation Preparation
PCB never arrived, was lost in transit
Final demo with working prototype instead of PCB
Work on presentation slides
Completed mock presentation

Week of 12/9: Final paper and Documentation
Finished final paper
Lab cleanup 
Finalized lab notebook
