# Worklog For Vikram Harish

Week: 9/2
- Brainstorming project ideas:
- Food freshness detector
- Interactive morning routine device
- Smart Mirror
- Smart Water Bottle
- Bicycle Blind Spot detection + auto turning off turnsignal
-  Automated shopping cart for curbside pick up

Week: 9/9
- team decided to pursue food freshness detector
-> needs to detect moisture, temp, humidity, ethylene
-> alert user for freshness
- worked on project approval (RFA) with group

Week: 9/16
- met with TA regarding RFA details and what we need to do for Proposal
- met with Gregg regarding Machine Shop and enclosure ideas for food freshness detector (SpoilSense)

Week: 9/30
- Working on Design Document with group
- ironing over speciifc details
- TA provided some details about development and strength of BLE signal through fridge door, need to confirm with speaker
- found and ordered ethylene sensor

Week 10/7 
- Design Review feedback receieved, need to collect data with sensor
- Need to refine some details
- lots of testing needed but sensor might take a while to come in because it is obscure
- Design review of initial PCB
-> might need to test with other VOC Sensor
-> use through hole LED instead of multicolor LED
-> need to find right footprint of ESP32 and complete schematic for ESP32 - getting from TA

Week: 10/14
- researching different ethylene sensor but hard to find reasonably priced/appropriate one for our application
- PCB development being done, trying to help where I can
- Started writing code for micrcontroller, having difficulties with serial monitor connection
- scrapping temp and relative humidity monitoring
- PCB development is taking a bit of time, need to ask help from TA/friends

Week: 10/21
- having trouble with finding footprints for certain components
- CFOP num so we can start ordering other parts
- Ethylene sensor not showing up in time, BME testing going on
- finalized and submitted PCB for 3rd round order

Week: 10/28
- got serial monitor to work for ESP on Arduino IDE
- conducting tests with BME680 in testing environment but to no avail
- found MICS 5524 VOC sensor with detect methane, ethanol, ammonia, carbon monoxide
-  orderd MICS 5524 breakout board for testing
- Set up meeting with TA for PCB help


Week: 11/4
- Found library for MICS 5524, developing testing program for ESP
- Need to conduct tests for threshold for spoilage detection
- Fixed Design Doc and submitted for regrade
- 1st iteration PCB came in, missing a lot of things like power and programming interace for ESP
- Need to make necessary changes

Week: 11/11
- conducting tests for MICs 5524 sensor, seems to be able to detect CH4 and NH3 pretty well with some inconsistencies
- Finalizing 2nd iteration of PCB, added power distribution and flashing interface
- signed up for Demo/presentation
- threshold found at 3000 for CH4 and 50 for NH3
- wriitng program to set up client-server architecture for external and internal modules respectively

Week: 11/18
- BLE communication works and LED is on when threshold is reached
- Had mock demo with TA, demonstrated working protoype on breadboard
- put in order for new PCB, should be here after break so we can solder and test before final demo

Week: 12/2
- PCB lost in transit, had to do final demo with breadboard prototype
- Began working on presentation slides and speaker notes
- finalized how we will divide presentation
- had mock presentation, got good feedback, need to work on delivery of presentation and add R and V information

Week: 12/9
- completed final presentation
- working on final paper, mostly just expanding on speaker notes from presentation 
- getting ready for lab clean up
- submited final paper, added all info, looked at past ones for reference in format/organization, including all relevant details from developing SpoilSense
